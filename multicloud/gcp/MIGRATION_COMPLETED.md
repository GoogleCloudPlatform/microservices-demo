# Project Consolidation & Remote State Migration - Completed

## Summary

Successfully consolidated all infrastructure to the **network-obs-demo** project and migrated Terraform state to Google Cloud Storage.

## Changes Completed

### 1. ✅ Project Consolidation
- **Removed** all references to `przemeksroka-joonix-gke-std` project
- **Deleted** `furniture.tf` file (contained old project resources)
- **Removed** 30 resources from Terraform state that were in the old project:
  - Furniture VPC, subnet, VM, and NAT resources
  - VPN gateways, tunnels, and BGP routers
  - Food service API enablements

### 2. ✅ Remote State Configuration
- **Created** GCS bucket: `gs://network-obs-demo-terraform-state/`
- **Enabled** versioning on bucket for state recovery
- **Configured** Terraform backend to use GCS
- **Migrated** local state to remote storage
- **Removed** local state files from workspace

### 3. ✅ Git Configuration
- Verified `.gitignore` excludes state files (`*.tfstate*`)
- State files will never be committed to Git
- Remote state enables team collaboration

### 4. ✅ Documentation Updated
- Updated `TERRAFORM_SYNC_SUMMARY.md` with new single-project setup
- Added remote state management instructions
- Removed all references to old project

## Current Infrastructure

All resources are now in **network-obs-demo** project:

### CRM Service (asia-east1)
- VPC, subnet, VM, firewalls
- 3 VPC peering connections

### Accounting Service (us-central1)
- VPC Access Connector for Cloud Run

### Inventory Service (europe-west1)
- VPC, subnets, VM, instance group
- Load balancer with health checks
- Private Service Connect resources

### Food Service (europe-west1)
- Configuration ready for Cloud Run deployment

## Terraform State

**Location**: `gs://network-obs-demo-terraform-state/terraform/state/`

**Current resources**: 28 resources managed in state
- All in network-obs-demo project
- All networking and compute resources
- No resources from old project

## Variable Configuration

The setup uses `var.project_id` consistently throughout - no hardcoded project IDs:

```hcl
# All services use:
project = var.project_id

# Configured in terraform.tfvars:
project_id = "network-obs-demo"
```

This makes it easy to deploy to different projects in the future.

## Next Steps

You can now safely use Terraform to manage your infrastructure:

```bash
# 1. Always initialize first (pulls remote state)
terraform init

# 2. Plan changes before applying
terraform plan

# 3. Apply changes when ready
terraform apply

# 4. View current state
terraform state list
```

## Important Notes

### State is Remote
- State is stored in GCS, not locally
- Multiple team members can work with same state
- Automatic state locking prevents conflicts
- State file has versioning enabled for recovery

### No Local State Files
- `terraform.tfstate` files removed from workspace
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude any future state files
- State will never be committed to Git

### Single Project
- All infrastructure in `network-obs-demo`
- No hardcoded project IDs
- Easy to change project via `terraform.tfvars`

## Verification

Verify the remote state is working:

```bash
# Check state location
terraform state list

# Should show ~28 resources all in network-obs-demo
```

Verify state is in GCS:

```bash
gsutil ls gs://network-obs-demo-terraform-state/terraform/state/
# Should show: default.tfstate
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert any changes:

1. **State recovery**: GCS bucket has versioning enabled
   ```bash
   gsutil ls -a gs://network-obs-demo-terraform-state/terraform/state/
   ```

2. **Configuration recovery**: Git history has all previous versions
   ```bash
   git log --oneline multicloud/gcp/
   ```

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Single project deployment (network-obs-demo)  
✅ No hardcoded project IDs  
✅ Remote state in GCS  
✅ Local state removed  
✅ State excluded from Git  
✅ Documentation updated  
✅ All resources tracked in Terraform
