**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of an 11-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

Google uses this application to demonstrate the use of technologies like
Kubernetes, GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, and gRPC. This application
works on any Kubernetes cluster, like Google
Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It’s **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

## Interactive quickstart (GKE)

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fmicroservices-demo&shellonly=true&cloudshell_image=gcr.io/ds-artifacts-cloudshell/deploystack_custom_image)

## Quickstart (GKE)

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the repository.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo
   cd microservices-demo/
   ```

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.
  
4. Confirm the services have been enabled for your project.

   ```sh
   gcloud services list --enabled --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```


5. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

6. Deploy Online Boutique to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```

7. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   adservice-76bdd69666-ckc5j               1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   cartservice-66d497c6b7-dp5jr             1/1     Running   0          2m59s
   checkoutservice-666c784bd6-4jd22         1/1     Running   0          3m1s
   currencyservice-5d5d496984-4jmd7         1/1     Running   0          2m59s
   emailservice-667457d9d6-75jcq            1/1     Running   0          3m2s

   paymentservice-68596d6dd6-bf6bv          1/1     Running   0          3m
   productcatalogservice-557d474574-888kr   1/1     Running   0          3m
   recommendationservice-69c56b74d4-7z8r5   1/1     Running   0          3m1s
   redis-cart-5f59546cdd-5jnqf              1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   ```

8. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Online Boutique.

9. Congrats! You've deployed the default Online Boutique. To deploy a different variation of Online Boutique (e.g., with Google Cloud Operations tracing, Istio, etc.), see [Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize](#deploy-online-boutique-variations-with-kustomize).

10. Once you are done with it, delete the GKE cluster.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters delete online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Deleting the cluster may take a few minutes.

## Use Terraform to provision a GKE cluster and deploy Online Boutique

The [`/terraform` folder](/terraform) contains instructions for using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) to replicate the steps from [**Quickstart (GKE)**](#quickstart-gke) above.

## Other deployment variations

- **Istio/Anthos Service Mesh**: [See these instructions.](/kustomize/components/service-mesh-istio/README.md)
- **non-GKE clusters (Minikube, Kind)**: see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md)

## Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize

The [`/kustomize` folder](/kustomize) contains instructions for customizing the deployment of Online Boutique with different variations such as:
* integrating with [Google Cloud Operations](/kustomize/components/google-cloud-operations/)
* replacing the in-cluster Redis cache with [Google Cloud Memorystore (Redis)](/kustomize/components/memorystore), [AlloyDB](/kustomize/components/alloydb) or [Google Cloud Spanner](/kustomize/components/spanner)
* etc.

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling** and **Tracing**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

## Development

See the [Development guide](/docs/development-guide.md) to learn how to run and develop this app locally.
