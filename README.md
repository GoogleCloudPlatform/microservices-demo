# Hipster Shop: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo Application

This project contains a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app called **“Hipster Shop”** where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like
Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application
works on any Kubernetes cluster (such as a local one), as well as Google
Kubernetes Engine. It’s **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

## Service Architecture

**Hipster Shop** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Stackdriver APM](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

## Installation

We offer three installation methods:

1. **Running locally with “Docker for Desktop”** (~20 minutes) You will build
   and deploy microservices images to a single-node Kubernetes cluster running
   on your development machine.

2. **Running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)”** (~30 minutes) You will build,
   upload and deploy the container images to a Kubernetes cluster on Google
   Cloud.

3. **Using pre-built container images:** (~10 minutes, you will still need to
   follow one of the steps above up until `skaffold run` command). With this
   option, you will use pre-built container images that are available publicly,
   instead of building them yourself, which takes a long time).

### Option 1: Running locally with “Docker for Desktop”

> 💡 Recommended if you're planning to develop the application or giving it a
> try on your local cluster.

1. Install tools to run a Kubernetes cluster locally:

   - kubectl (can be installed via `gcloud components install kubectl`)
   - Docker for Desktop (Mac/Windows): It provides Kubernetes support as [noted
     here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes/).
   - [skaffold]( https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/) (ensure version ≥v0.20)

1. Launch “Docker for Desktop”. Go to Preferences:

   - choose “Enable Kubernetes”,
   - set CPUs to at least 3, and Memory to at least 6.0 GiB
   - on the "Disk" tab, set at least 32 GB disk space

1. Run `kubectl get nodes` to verify you're connected to “Kubernetes on Docker”.

1. Run `skaffold run` (first time will be slow, it can take ~20 minutes).
   This will build and deploy the application. If you need to rebuild the images
   automatically as you refactor the code, run `skaffold dev` command.

1. Run `kubectl get pods` to verify the Pods are ready and running. The
   application frontend should be available at http://localhost:80 on your
   machine.

### Option 2: Running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

> 💡 Recommended if you're using Google Cloud Platform and want to try it on
> a realistic cluster.

1.  Install tools specified in the previous section (Docker, kubectl, skaffold)

1.  Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster and make sure `kubectl` is pointing
    to the cluster.

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
    ```

    ```sh
    gcloud container clusters create demo --enable-autoupgrade \
        --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=3 --max-nodes=10 --num-nodes=5 --zone=us-central1-a
    ```

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

1.  Enable Google Container Registry (GCR) on your GCP project and configure the
    `docker` CLI to authenticate to GCR:

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
    ```

    ```sh
    gcloud auth configure-docker -q
    ```

1.  In the root of this repository, run `skaffold run --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]`,
    where [PROJECT_ID] is your GCP project ID.

    This command:

    - builds the container images
    - pushes them to GCR
    - applies the `./kubernetes-manifests` deploying the application to
      Kubernetes.

    **Troubleshooting:** If you get "No space left on device" error on Google
    Cloud Shell, you can build the images on Google Cloud Build: [Enable the
    Cloud Build
    API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com),
    then run `skaffold run -p gcb --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]` instead.

1.  Find the IP address of your application, then visit the application on your
    browser to confirm installation.

        kubectl get service frontend-external

    **Troubleshooting:** A Kubernetes bug (will be fixed in 1.12) combined with
    a Skaffold [bug](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/issues/887)
    causes load balancer to not to work even after getting an IP address. If you
    are seeing this, run `kubectl get service frontend-external -o=yaml | kubectl apply -f-`
    to trigger load balancer reconfiguration.

### Option 3: Using Pre-Built Container Images

> 💡 Recommended if you want to deploy the app faster in fewer steps to an
> existing cluster.

**NOTE:** If you need to create a Kubernetes cluster locally or on the cloud,
follow "Option 1" or "Option 2" until you reach the `skaffold run` step.

This option offers you pre-built public container images that are easy to deploy
by deploying the [release manifest](./release) directly to an existing cluster.

**Prerequisite**: a running Kubernetes cluster (either local or on cloud).

1. Clone this repository, and go to the repository directory
1. Run `kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml` to deploy the app.
1. Run `kubectl get pods` to see pods are in a Ready state.
1. Find the IP address of your application, then visit the application on your
   browser to confirm installation.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service/frontend-external
   ```

### (Optional) Deploying on a Istio-installed GKE cluster

> **Note:** you followed GKE deployment steps above, run `skaffold delete` first
> to delete what's deployed.

1. Create a GKE cluster (described in "Option 2").

1. Use [Istio on GKE add-on](https://cloud.google.com/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/installing)
   to install Istio to your existing GKE cluster.

   ```sh
   gcloud beta container clusters update demo \
       --zone=us-central1-a \
       --update-addons=Istio=ENABLED \
       --istio-config=auth=MTLS_PERMISSIVE
   ```

2. (Optional) Enable Stackdriver Tracing/Logging with Istio Stackdriver Adapter
   by [following this guide](https://cloud.google.com/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/installing#enabling_tracing_and_logging).

3. Install the automatic sidecar injection (annotate the `default` namespace
   with the label):

   ```sh
   kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
   ```

4. Apply the manifests in [`./istio-manifests`](./istio-manifests) directory.
   (This is required only once.)

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./istio-manifests
   ```

5. Deploy the application with `skaffold run --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]`.

6. Run `kubectl get pods` to see pods are in a healthy and ready state.

7. Find the IP address of your Istio gateway Ingress or Service, and visit the
   application.

   ```sh
   INGRESS_HOST="$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway \
      -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"
   echo "$INGRESS_HOST"
   ```

   ```sh
   curl -v "http://$INGRESS_HOST"
   ```

### Cleanup

If you've deployed the application with `skaffold run` command, you can run
`skaffold delete` to clean up the deployed resources.

If you've deployed the application with `kubectl apply -f [...]`, you can
run `kubectl delete -f [...]` with the same argument to clean up the deployed
resources.
