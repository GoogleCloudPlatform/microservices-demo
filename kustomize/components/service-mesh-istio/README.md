# Istio Service Mesh

You can use [Istio](https://istio.io) to enable [service mesh features](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/overview) such as traffic management, observability, and security. Istio can be provisioned using Anthos Service Mesh (ASM), the Open Source Software (OSS) istioctl tool, or via other Istio providers. You can then label individual namespaces for sidecar injection and configure an Istio gateway to replace the frontend-external load balancer.

# Provision a GKE Cluster
 
Create a GKE cluster with at least 4 nodes, machine type `e2-standard-4`, [GKE Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity), and the [Kubernetes Gateway API resources](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/deploying-gateways):

_Note: using the classic `istio-ingressgateway` instead of Gateway API is another option not covered in this component._

```bash
PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>"
ZONE="<your-GCP-zone>"
CLUSTER_NAME="onlineboutique"

gcloud container clusters create ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
    --zone=${ZONE} \
    --machine-type=e2-standard-4 \
    --num-nodes=4 \
    --workload-pool ${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog \
    --gateway-api "standard"
```

# Provision and Configure Istio Service Mesh

## Provision managed `Anthos Service Mesh` via Fleet feature API

ASM provides a managed service mesh experience that includes Managed Control Plane (MCP) and Managed Data Plane (MDP) upgrades.

The recommended way to [install ASM](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/managed/provision-managed-anthos-service-mesh) is using the fleet feature API:

```bash
# Enable ASM and Fleet APIs
gcloud services enable mesh.googleapis.com --project ${PROJECT_ID}

# Enable ASM on the project's Fleet
gcloud container fleet mesh enable --project ${PROJECT_ID}

# Register GKE cluster with Fleet
gcloud container fleet memberships register ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --gke-cluster ${ZONE}/${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --enable-workload-identity

FLEET_PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} --format 'value(projectNumber)')
# Apply mesh_id label to clusters that should be added to the service mesh
gcloud container clusters update --project ${PROJECT_ID} ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --zone ${ZONE} --update-labels="mesh_id=proj-$FLEET_PROJECT_NUMBER"

# Enable managed Anthos Service Mesh on the cluster
gcloud container fleet mesh update --project ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --management automatic \
    --memberships ${CLUSTER_NAME}

# Enable sidecar injection for Kubernetes namespace where workload is deployed
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection- istio.io/rev=asm-managed --overwrite
```
_Note: You can ignore any label "istio-injection" not found errors. The istio-injection=enabled annotation would also work but ASM prefers revision labels._

Follow the [Managed ASM Verification](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/managed/provision-managed-anthos-service-mesh#verify_the_control_plane_has_been_provisioned) steps to confirm it is working.

## Provision OSS `Istio` via istioctl

Alternatively you can install OSS Istio by following the [getting started guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/):

```bash
# Install istio 1.17 or above
istioctl install --set profile=minimal -y

# Enable sidecar injection for Kubernetes namespace(s) where microservices-demo is deployed
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled

# Make sure the istiod injection webhook port 15017 is accessible via GKE master nodes
# Otherwise your replicaset-controller may be blocked when trying to create new pods with: 
#   Error creating: Internal error occurred: failed calling 
#     webhook "namespace.sidecar-injector.istio.io" ... context deadline exceeded
gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="name~gke-[0-9a-z-]*-master"
NAME                          NETWORK  DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW              DENY  DISABLED
gke-onlineboutique-c94d71e8-master  gke-vpc  INGRESS    1000      tcp:10250,tcp:443        False

# Update firewall rule (or create a new one) to allow webhook port 15017
gcloud compute firewall-rules update gke-onlineboutique-c94d71e8-master \
    --allow tcp:10250,tcp:443,tcp:15017
```

# Deploy and Validate Online Boutique with `Istio`

## Deploy via Kustomize component

Once the service mesh and namespace injection are configured, you can then deploy the Istio manifests using Kustomize. You should also include the [service-accounts component](../service-accounts) if you plan on using AuthorizationPolicies.

From the `kustomize/` folder at the root level of this repository, execute these commands:
```bash
kustomize edit add component components/service-mesh-istio
```

This will update the `kustomize/kustomization.yaml` file which could be similar to:
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- base
components:
- components/service-mesh-istio
```

_Note: `service-mesh-istio` component includes the same delete patch as the `non-public-frontend` component. Trying to use both those components in your kustomization.yaml file will result in an error._

You can locally render these manifests by running `kubectl kustomize .` or deploying them by running `kubectl apply -k .`

The output should be similar to:
```

# Verify Online Boutique Deployment

Run `kubectl get pods,gateway,svc` to see pods and gateway are in a healthy and ready state.

The output should be similar to:

Find the IP address of your Istio gateway and visit the application frontend in a web browser.

```sh
INGRESS_HOST="$(kubectl get gateway istio-gateway \
    -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[*].value}')"
curl -v "http://$INGRESS_HOST"
```
