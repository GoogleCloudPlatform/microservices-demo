If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target object copy.</p> <p>When you perform a <code>CopyObject</code> operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can use other appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target object with a KMS key, an Amazon S3 managed key, or a customer-provided key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes your data to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If the source object for the copy is stored in Amazon S3 using SSE-C, you must provide the necessary encryption information in your request so that Amazon S3 can decrypt the object for copying.

If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a KMS key, an Amazon S3 managed key, or a customer-provided key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html\">UploadPart</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. You can request that Amazon S3 save the uploaded parts encrypted with server-side encryption with an Amazon S3 managed key (SSE-S3), an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C). </p> <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the <code>kms:Decrypt</code> and <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions\">Multipart upload API and permissions</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.</p> <p> For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <dl> <dt>Access Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>Amazon S3 encrypts data by using server-side encryption with an Amazon S3 managed key (SSE-S3) by default. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can request that Amazon S3 encrypts data at rest by using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption keys (SSE-C).</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services managed key (<code>aws/s3</code>) and KMS customer managed keys stored in Key Management Service (KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</code> </p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (<code>aws/s3</code> key) in KMS to protect the data.</p> </note> <important> <p>All <code>GET</code> and <code>PUT</code> requests for an object protected by KMS fail if you don't make them by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Signature Version 4.</p> </important> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html\"> Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Using ACLs</a>. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL (<code>x-amz-acl</code>) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-write</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account</p> <note> <p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N.

For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Using ACLs</a>. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have <code>WRITE_ACP</code> permission.</p> <p>You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify the ACL in the request body</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify permissions using request headers</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.</p> </note> <p>Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.</p> <important> <p>If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the <code>AccessControlListNotSupported</code> error code.

When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.

Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default.

For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier.</p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Expedited</code> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Standard</code> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Bulk</code> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html\">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html\"> Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html\">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html\">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">Object Lifecycle Management</a> in <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> </dd> <dt>Responses</dt> <dd> <p>A successful action returns either the <code>200 OK</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code> status code. </p> <ul> <li> <p>If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns <code>202 Accepted</code> in the response. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> in the response. </p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Special errors:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have three mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
