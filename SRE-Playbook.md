# Trouble Shooting Playbook ðŸ“š

This playbook is here to help you debug issues when something in the app isn't working as expected.

Start by checking the logs of the Kubernetes podsâ€”either for all services or just the one you think is most likely to be causing the problem.

For example, if adding an item to the cart fails, youâ€™ll want to look at the logs for the cartservice.

If you get stuck or have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us at talk@fuzzylabs.ai.
