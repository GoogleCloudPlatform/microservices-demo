# This file configures the New Relic Python Agent.
#
# The path to the configuration file should be supplied to the function
# newrelic.agent.initialize() when the agent is being initialized.
#
# The configuration file follows a structure similar to what you would
# find for Microsoft Windows INI files. For further information on the
# configuration file format see the Python ConfigParser documentation at:
#
#    https://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html
#
# For further discussion on the behaviour of the Python agent that can
# be configured via this configuration file see:

# Here are the settings that are common to all environments.

[newrelic]

# You must specify the license key associated with your New
# Relic account. This may also be set using the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
# environment variable. This key binds the Python Agent's data to
# your account in the New Relic service. For more information on
# storing and generating license keys, see
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key

# The application name. Set this to be the name of your
# application as you would like it to show up in New Relic UI.
# You may also set this using the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable.
# The UI will then auto-map instances of your application into a
# entry on your home dashboard page. You can also specify multiple
# app names to group your aggregated data. For further details,
# please see:
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app/
app_name = emailservice

# When "true", the agent collects performance data about your
# application and reports this data to the New Relic UI at
# newrelic.com. This global switch is normally overridden for
# each environment below. It may also be set using the
# NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE environment variable.
monitor_mode = true

# Sets the name of a file to log agent messages to. Whatever you
# set this to, you must ensure that the permissions for the
# containing directory and the file itself are correct, and
# that the user that your web application runs as can write out
# to the file. If not able to out a log file, it is also
# possible to say "stderr" and output to standard error output.
# This would normally result in output appearing in your web
# server log. It can also be set using the NEW_RELIC_LOG
# environment variable.
log_file = stdout

# Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file, if
# a log file location has been provided. Possible values, in
# increasing order of detail, are: "critical", "error", "warning",
# "info" and "debug". When reporting any agent issues to New
# Relic technical support, the most useful setting for the
# support engineers is "debug". However, this can generate a lot
# of information very quickly, so it is best not to keep the
# agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce the
# problem you are experiencing. This may also be set using the
# NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.
log_level = info

# High Security Mode enforces certain security settings, and prevents
# them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to New
# Relic. Enabling High Security Mode means that request parameters are
# not collected and SQL can not be sent to New Relic in its raw form.
# To activate High Security Mode, it must be set to 'true' in this
# local .ini configuration file AND be set to 'true' in the
# server-side configuration in the New Relic user interface. It can
# also be set using the NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY environment variable.
# For details, see
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/subscriptions/high-security

# The Python Agent will attempt to connect directly to the New
# Relic service. If there is an intermediate firewall between
# your host and the New Relic service that requires you to use a
# HTTP proxy, then you should set both the "proxy_host" and
# "proxy_port" settings to t he required values for the HTTP
# proxy. The "proxy_user" and "proxy_pass" settings should
# additionally be set if proxy authentication is implemented by
# the HTTP proxy. The "proxy_scheme" setting dictates what
# protocol scheme is used in talking to the HTTP proxy. This
# would normally always be set as "http" which will result in the
# agent then using a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end to
# end encryption.
# See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/#proxy

# capturing of request parameters, first ensure that the setting

# setting. For details about attributes configuration, please
